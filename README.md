# token-generator

The token generator is used to generate NFTs in localnet for use in the @soliage/foliage-detection repository. This is needed as a new localnet will not have retained NFTs from previous runs.
 
## Quickstart
`npm install`
`npm start`


Runs for a long time. When finished, copy the tokens.json file to the foliage-detection repository
